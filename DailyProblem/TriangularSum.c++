/*2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array*/

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
/*
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 8
Explanation:
The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Since there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.*/


int triangularSum(vector<int>& nums) {

}


int main()
{
    
    return 0;
